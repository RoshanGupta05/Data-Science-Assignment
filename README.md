# Data-Science-Assignment

This project focuses on analyzing customer and transaction data to segment customers and derive business insights that can help improve business strategies.

Key Parts of the Project:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We cleaned and combined customer and transaction data.
We visualized the data to better understand customer behavior and trends.
Based on this analysis, we extracted 5 key business insights.
2. Customer Segmentation:
We used clustering techniques to group customers based on their purchasing habits and profiles.
We assessed the quality of these customer clusters using evaluation metrics like the DB Index.
The clusters were then visualized to show distinct customer groups.
